[00:42.26] You and I
[00:42.38] 
[00:43.56] Jumping off the edge

[00:52.53] 
[00:55.64] We're rising, we're falling
[00:55.77] 
[00:58.93] We'll make it through
[00:59.03] 
[01:01.95] We're climbing, we're soaring
[01:02.06]

[01:14.96] 
[01:21.17] A thousand views
[01:34.29] 
[01:37.40] Somewhere by the emerald sea
[01:37.52] 
[01:40.68] Where the moon and water meet
[01:40.78] 
[01:43.85] Somewhere close to harmony
[01:43.97] 
[01:47.16] When the world is sound asleep
[01:47.26] 
[01:50.41] Something's gonna bring the change
[01:50.51] 
[01:53.61] Journeys we are meant to take
[01:53.72] 
[01:56.92] Something at the edge of space
[01:57.03] 
[02:00.16] Calling us to fly away
[02:00.27] 
[02:01.43] Don't you be afraid
[02:01.54] 
[02:02.57] Everything will change
